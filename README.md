 | Rize up now                                                      |
 |                                                                  |
 | Rize up and stand among the strong and brave that walk the earth |
 | Rize up, unite within this movement today                        |
 | Rize and stand high above the ruinings of Babylon                |
 | Rize up for in these times you've gots to know where you stand   |
 |                                                                  |
 | And every time they try to tell us                               |
 | They really building peace, still they go to war                 |
 | So don't get lost in their battles when                          |
 | You know that Truth is gonna be your best friend                 |
 |                                                                  |
 | Sooner or later the time must arrive                             |
 | Open your heart now and open your eyes                           |
 | The hotter the fire, the brighter our flame                      |
 | Never trust a system that's got you in a ball and chain          |
 | Oh yeah                                                          |
 |                                                                  |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up now!                                    |
 | Jah!                                                             |
 |                                                                  |
 | Rize up because you love the Truth and understand it's worth     |
 | Rize up no matter what the preacher may say                      |
 | Resistin' high above the tricks of modern slavery                |
 | Rize up cause if you can't, we're not gonna change a thing!      |
 |                                                                  |
 | Yeah, and it really makes me wonder                              |
 | However did we let this go on for so long                        |
 | Exploit the Earth until the very end                             |
 | That's how it happens when control stays with dem greedy men     |
 |                                                                  |
 | The concrete jungle is a crazy space, yes                        |
 | So don't forget your roots now, don't forget your place          |
 | If we can't change, humanity may fall down                       |
 | So get on up, gather round now, we're calling you out, up yeah   |
 |                                                                  |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up, right away!                            |
 | Rize Up, Get Up, Rize Up now!                                    |
